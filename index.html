    <h1>Unicorn</h1>
    
    <p>The unicorn is a legendary creature that has been described since antiquity as a beast with a single large, 
      pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead. The unicorn was depicted in ancient seals of the Indus 
      Valley Civilization and was mentioned by the ancient Greeks in accounts of natural history by various writers, 
      including Ctesias, Strabo, Pliny the Younger, Aelian and Cosmas Indicopleustes. The Bible also describes an 
      animal, the re'em, which some versions translate as unicorn.</p>
    
    <p>In European folklore, the unicorn is often depicted
      as a white horse-like or goat-like animal with a long horn and cloven hooves (sometimes a goat's beard). In the 
      Middle Ages and Renaissance, it was commonly described as an extremely wild woodland creature, a symbol of purity 
      and grace, which could be captured only by a virgin. In the encyclopedias, its horn was said to have the power 
      to render poisoned water potable and to heal sickness. In medieval and Renaissance times, the tusk of the narwhal 
      was sometimes sold as unicorn horn.</p>
    
    <p>Even in the twenty-first century, the unicorn holds a place in popular culture. 
      It is often used as a symbol of fantasy or rarity.</p>
